# Movie Sagas

The project is a full stack web application that gives user the ability to view existing titles, navigate to view details, and edit those details including the option to add genre tags. The app uses PostgreSQL for a database, Node.js, Express and Axios on the server-side, and React.js and Redux/Redux Sagas for front end frameworks. 

## Database Set up

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
3. You will need to create the junction table between the `movies` and `genres` tables!

## Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`
